# US OCP Learning Plan for Azure Synapse (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse)

Azure Synapse is an analytical service evolved from Azure SQL Data Warehouse that brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics.  Provisioned or on-demand, Azure Synapse offers a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for analytics, BI, and machine learning needs.

Below you will find the content in developing your business solutions.  This content is meant for a Program Manager who is designing, developing and launching their product in Azure to go to market.  This workflow will be the necessary steps to engage with Microsoft and build your solution.  Additionally, you will be able to get it into our GTM catalog and co-sell with Microsoft account teams.
